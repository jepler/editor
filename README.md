# editor

A minimal terminal text editor for CircuitPython written in Python with a tiny curses subset called "dang".

![](https://wasimlorgat.com/posts/images/editor.svg)

## Check out the accompanying tutorial for the original editor

... [How to build a text editor with Python and curses](https://wasimlorgat.com/posts/editor), which walks you through series of fifteen incremental coding problems concluding in a minimal text editor.

The tutorial was featured in [Episode 221 of the PythonBytes podcast](https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/221/pattern-matching-and-accepting-change-in-python-with-brett-cannon) by Michael Kennedy and Brian Okken.

## Credits

Many thanks to the following people and projects for sharing their great work, upon which a lot of this was based!

-   [Wasim Lorgat (@seeM)](https://github.com/seeM), from whom the CircuitPython version is forked
-   Many thanks to Pavel Spirhanzl and Alexandre Pajak for their keen eyes in identifying bugs in early versions.
-   Gary Bernhardt's [Text Editor From Scratch](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/text-editor-from-scratch) screencast.
-   Anthony Sottile's [babi](https://github.com/asottile/babi/).
-   [nano](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/nano.git/tree/) source.
-   [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) source. In my opinion, the best way to explore the source is through Emacs' built-in help commands.
